//There are two types of binary heap: Max Binary and Min Binary. In max binary parent node has greater value than its children nodes while in min binary parent node has smaller value.
//For any index n in an array, the left child is stored at 2n + 1 and right child is stored at 2n + 2. 
//For any child at index n, the parent node is at Math.floor((n - 1)/2)
